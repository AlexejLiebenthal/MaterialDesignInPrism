# Material Design In Prism

This is a project, where I put all the pieces together, to have an nice quickstart WPF-App template with **[Material Design In Xaml](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit)** and the **[Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism)** for an amazing, modern Look&Feel on Windows.

Feel free to contribute.
